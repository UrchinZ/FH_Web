				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>
				The RPI formula hybrid team prepares students to use their skills and knowledge to succeed in an engineering workplace, practice professionalism, and demonstrate skill in project management techniques. The team strives to design, build, and enter a racecar in the Formula Hybrid Competition. The competition teaches through means of application; students take knowledge learned in the classroom and apply it to the vehicle. In addition, the team provides a focused, student-run, and innovative environment. Students learn to work with dedicated, self-driven members from diverse disciplinary backgrounds.
